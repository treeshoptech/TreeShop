# TreeShop

**Map-First Business Operations Platform for Tree Care Professionals**

## Overview

TreeShop is a revolutionary iOS app that treats geography as the primary data structure for tree care operations. Unlike traditional directory-based CRUD applications, TreeShop positions the map as the interface where every tree, job, and customer exists first as a location.

**The Differentiator:** When you drive past a property where you've worked, TreeShop shows you. When you tap a parcel, you see every tree scored, every job completed, every dollar earned - all in one card.
